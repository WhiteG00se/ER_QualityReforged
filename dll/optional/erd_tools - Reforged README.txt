Due to antiviruses being tripped by ErdTools, we can no longer include it as part of the "optional" folder.

If you wish to use ErdTools, please download it from NexusMods directly from the author Nordgaren, then:

- put the DLL into the "dll\active" folder
- put our own "erd_tools.ini" from this folder into the "dll\active" folder

Thanks!
